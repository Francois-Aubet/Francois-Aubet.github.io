I am a senior research engineer at Google DeepMind where I work on Gemini. I am working predominantly on multimodal post-training.

Before working on Gemini, I was an applied scientist at Amazon / AWS where I worked on a range of time series related projects. I worked on [the simulator](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/how-peak-events-like-prime-day-helped-amazon-navigate-the-pandemic) that let's Amazon optimize its global supply chain, developing [probabilistic forecasting techniques](https://www.amazon.science/blog/improving-forecasting-by-learning-quantile-functions) to improve demand prediction.
I was the lead scientist for the [Quarterback grading](https://www.amazon.science/blog/the-science-behind-nfl-next-gen-stats-new-passing-metric) for the [American National Football League](https://www.nfl.com/news/next-gen-stats-intro-to-passing-score-metric).
I also pioniered the [use of synthetic data](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11636125B1/en) for [AWS DevOps Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/).
